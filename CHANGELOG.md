# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The analysis report has been completely redesigned: a flat, World Bank-
  appropriate visual language (navy/cyan bands, hairline footers, page
  numbers), a proper horizontal bar chart for processing times, clean map
  neatlines with outside-frame coordinate annotations, and minimap grids —
  the overview page shows the overall score plus dimension minimaps, each
  dimension page its factor minimaps, and each factor page its indicator
  minimaps. Funding/attribution moved to a styled closing page, blank pages
  are impossible (layer validity is checked first), the cover typo is fixed,
  and report maps no longer depend on the project CRS (which also hung
  report generation when no project CRS was set). `export_pdf` gained an
  optional dpi override for fast draft exports.

### Added

- Reverse-engineered Software Requirements Specification under `srs/`
  (branded Word + PDF deliverables, 18 UML diagrams as SVG, one-shot
  `srs/build.sh` pipeline writing directly into the Kartoza Word template).
- SRS build toolchain in the dev shell (plantuml, python-docx, pillow,
  libreoffice, Lato).
- GeoPackage corruption causal analysis
  (`docs/gpkg-corruption-causal-analysis.md`).
- SRS chapter 8 "Shipped model catalogue", generated from
  `geest/resources/model.json` at build time
  (`srs/scripts/gen_model_catalogue.py`): a page per dimension and per
  factor, every indicator with its defaults, brand-styled WBS tree diagrams
  per dimension, and an indicator × processor capability matrix rendered as
  SVG/PNG.
- QGIS launcher scripts now symlink the working-tree plugin into the GEOE3
  profile's `python/plugins` folder before launching
  (`scripts/ensure_plugin_link.sh`).
- Launcher scripts pin QGIS to a light palette even when the desktop is in
  dark mode (`scripts/qgis_light_theme_startup.py` via `PYQGIS_STARTUP`;
  Qt 6.8+ colour-scheme override with a light-Fusion-palette fallback).
- GeoPackage write-path hardening (causal analysis §5, all four items):
  chunk tiles now go through the single unified writer connection, every
  WAL checkpoint in the process is serialised behind one lock, all layers
  (including `chunks`) are pre-created before worker threads start, and
  map refreshes are deferred while the writer is active.
- Environmental-hazard indicators now expose a clickable link to the source
  dataset in the World Bank Data Catalog for the selected hazard (fire,
  flood, landslide, cyclone, drought) (#398).
- Regional analyses now pull population demographics automatically from S2S
  when the population source is S2S — new population-vector processing task
  plus a population-source UI in the analysis aggregation dialog (#431).
- Nighttime Lights supports NOAA threshold classification (fixed Black
  Marble value ranges, 5 classes) alongside Jenks Natural Breaks; the binary
  option was replaced by the NOAA thresholds option (#396).

### Changed

- The flake now sources QGIS from nixpkgs: `qgis` 4.x (latest) and
  `qgis-ltr` 3.44.x; the geospatial-nix and qgis-source inputs were removed
  and `flake.lock` updated accordingly. nixpkgs is pinned to the last
  revision with binary-cached QGIS builds.
- Dev shell Qt tooling moved from Qt 5 to Qt 6 (`kdePackages.*`) to match
  QGIS 4.x — nixpkgs rejects mixed Qt shells; each QGIS variant now gets the
  matching PyQt WebEngine binding (PyQt6 for 4.x, PyQt5 for LTR).
- The dev shell recreates `.venv` automatically when the nix python
  interpreter changes (a stale venv made pip write into the read-only
  store).
- Flood data sources now work at both analysis scales: the raster (DDH
  0–900) path is available in regional analyses and the S2S path in
  national/local ones, with the S2S join using intersection-MAX; the source
  is auto-derived from the indicator configuration (#423).
- Tree headings are now consistently Title Case (acronym/apostrophe-safe),
  normalised at render time so existing projects' stored model.json is
  unaffected.

### Fixed

- A broken or missing data source on one indicator no longer aborts a
  multi-indicator run with a raw Python traceback: workflow start-up
  errors are trapped at the queue boundary, the indicator's status icon
  flips to failed with an accessible explanation in its tooltip, and the
  rest of the queue continues. The known config-validation raises
  (multi-buffer, point-per-cell, OSM transport) now produce plain-language
  messages.
- GHSL tile download failures now raise a descriptive `GhslDownloadError`
  instead of surfacing later as a bare `FileNotFoundError` from zipfile;
  corrupt cached zips are removed so the next attempt re-downloads. The
  GHSL integration tests skip (rather than error) when the JRC service is
  unreachable, so CI no longer fails on network flakiness.
- SRS PDF conversion silently substituted DejaVu for the brand fonts and
  dropped bold: `srs/build.sh` now provisions Lato and JetBrains Mono via a
  throwaway fontconfig so PlantUML and LibreOffice embed the correct faces.
- GeoPackage self-healing hardening: locked/busy check results are now
  classified as "could not assess" instead of corruption, so the healer can
  never rebuild-and-swap a healthy database that is merely held by an active
  writer (regression tests added).
- QGIS 4 / PyQt6 crash in the open-project panel: `event.Resize` instance
  enum access replaced with `QEvent.Type.Resize` (works on PyQt5 too).
- QGIS 4 / PyQt6 plugin-load failures: all remaining unscoped Qt enum
  accesses (`QTreeView.InternalMove`/`NoEditTriggers`,
  `QFileDialog.ExistingFile`/`AcceptSave`, `QDockWidget.DockWidget*`,
  `QScrollArea.NoFrame`, `QAbstractScrollArea.AdjustToContents`,
  `QAbstractSpinBox.UpDownArrows`) replaced with their scoped forms — every
  Qt attribute reference in the package is now mechanically verified against
  both PyQt5 and PyQt6 by a new regression test
  (`test/test_qt_enum_compliance.py`), so this bug class is caught by the
  suite instead of at plugin load.
- QGIS 4 / PyQt6 crash when resizing data-source widgets: three widgets
  read `PM_DefaultFrameWidth` off a style *instance* — replaced with
  `QStyle.PixelMetric.PM_DefaultFrameWidth`, and the enum compliance test
  now also bans instance enum-member access (`style().PM_*`, `event.X`).
- Active Transport skipped as "unconfigured" although a layer was set: the
  polyline workflow now accepts the layer under any of its sibling mode
  keys (`osm_transport_polyline_per_cell_*`, `road_network_layer_path`),
  so switching analysis mode no longer orphans a configured layer; the
  decline log lists exactly which data-source keys are present. A new
  end-to-end suite (`test/test_workflow_job_e2e.py`) runs a real indicator
  through the production queue → job → factory → workflow chain on both
  QGIS images, covering the run path unit tests missed.
- Crash when running an indicator with no data source configured: six
  workflow `__init__` methods did `return False` on missing/invalid
  sources, which Python rejects with `TypeError: __init__() should return
  None`. They now raise `WorkflowNotConfiguredError`; the queue manager
  skips the job with a log entry and the tree panel shows a message-bar
  hint naming the unconfigured indicator. An AST regression test
  (`test/test_workflow_init_hygiene.py`) bans value-returns in workflow
  `__init__` methods.
- Plugin reloads no longer stack duplicate dock widgets: `unload()`
  reparents the dock before the queued deletion, and `initGui()` sweeps
  stale `GeoE3DockWidget` instances left by a crashed previous load.
- Plugin reloads no longer stack duplicate toolbar buttons ("GeoE3
  Settings" et al.): every unload phase is individually guarded so one
  failing step cannot abort the cleanup, all toolbar actions carry
  objectNames, and `initGui()` sweeps stale instances before creating new
  ones.
- QGIS 4 / PyQt6 plugin-load failure: the dock area persisted in QSettings
  is an int, which PyQt6 no longer auto-converts to `Qt.DockWidgetArea` —
  now normalised through `_to_dock_widget_area()` (invalid values fall back
  to the right dock) at every `addDockWidget` call, and the enum-vs-int
  dock-area comparison that silently broke tabifying is fixed. A new test
  (`test/test_geoe3_dock_construction.py`) builds the complete dock — all
  panels — on both PyQt5 and PyQt6 images so constructor-time porting
  regressions fail the suite instead of plugin load.
- GHSL masking (#420, #421): the GHSL options mask now uses the
  `ghsl_settlements` layer already stored in the study-area GeoPackage
  (clipped and reprojected at project setup) instead of depending on the
  `ghsl_settlements_layer.parquet` download path, so masked scoring no
  longer fails when that file is missing or empty.
- Landslide environmental-hazard scoring in regional analyses was reversed
  and is now corrected (#428).
- Regional S2S Nighttime Lights scoring was inaccurate: NTL classification
  now derives six dynamic classes from the data's own min–max range instead
  of Jenks breaks, so every cell value maps to a class and nothing renders
  unclassified (#424).
- Indicator dropdowns in the factor and dimension aggregation dialogs no
  longer shift left when toggling between indicators (vertical scrollbar
  pinned).
- Environmental-hazards datasource rows are better balanced: the source link
  sits beside the file selector, the layer combo is width-capped, and rows
  no longer hug the table border.
- Clicking the GeoE3 Score node now re-shows the last run result — the masked
  score when a mask is active — instead of always reverting to the raw
  score.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- GeoPackage self-healing module (`geest.core.gpkg_doctor`) that detects and
  repairs, in place, the corruption classes seen in the field: stale WAL
  journals, duplicated schema objects (`trigger ... already exists` /
  malformed database schema errors caused by historic write races), and
  structural btree damage (repaired via a rebuild, keeping the corrupt
  original as a `.corrupt-<timestamp>.bak` file).
- Automatic GeoPackage health checks (run in a background task so the UI
  never blocks): on project open, after every workflow run completes, and at
  the end of study area creation.
- Self-heal-and-retry in workflow CRS resolution, so an analysis run against
  a corrupted study area GeoPackage repairs it and continues instead of
  failing with "Could not determine CRS for study area".
- Unit tests for the self-healing module (`test/test_gpkg_doctor.py`).

### Fixed

- Root cause of study area GeoPackage corruption: `SQLITE_USE_OGR_VFS=YES`
  was set process-wide during study area creation. The OGR VSI file layer
  does not implement SQLite file locking, so concurrent write connections
  could interleave page writes unprotected, producing duplicated
  `sqlite_master` pages ("trigger rtree_..._delete already exists"). The
  option is now forced off.
